export const certifictiondescription="In the past few years, doing the search of massive amounts of data finds “hidden”and valuable information within it growing.his can result in heavy processing in considerable data,leading to the development of solutions to process such huge information based on distributed and parallel processing.MapReduce is a programming model and associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, reducing the function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.The Mapreduce framework has been caught by many dif erent areas. It is presently a practical model for data-intensive applications due to its simple interface of programming,high scalability, and ability to withstand the subjection to flaws.Also , it is capable of processing a high proportion of data in distributed computing environments(DCE).MapReduce, on numerous occasions,has proved to be applicable to a wide-range of domains"
